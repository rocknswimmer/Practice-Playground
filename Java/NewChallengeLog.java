//8/11 another hiring event on hackerEarth where I ran out of time thanks to needing to spend more than 30 minutes extracting and testing the extraction of the test information from a document, since they waste users time by not having a proper test environment that can run the function being tested by inputing varibles and running multiple sites. could have also finished in time if not translating javascript to java.

//8/17 remo confusing take another hacker rank but then try to test on site. learned about python lambda functions.

//8/18 August Circuit start - slow solution for first problem gets me to 60/100, need to figure out how to optimize in java. adjusted and got 100! learned a good bit from input manipulation despite how annoying it is to spend most of each problem figuring out how to optimally extract data. For example I had issues splitting a string and comparing the values for equivalence to avoid converting them to integers. There I learned for arrays of strings, you must use .equals instead of ==.

//8/20 coding challenge that was too easy/basic

//9/30 react coding challenge, could not compare my solution to their tests, but as far as I can tell I found solutions to all react challenges. finished 30 minutes early but not sure if thats what effiecency means for evaluations or efficent enough. Not sure if I should have put the todo component inside of a list item or not, made considerations for it while coding, but then noticed the built component and just mapped returning those.

//10/2 decided to retake linkedIn's react multiple choice assessment and only know I did better than 64% of takers, not my score out of 15. I'm not sure which site offers less useful assessments since indeed just gives you a range and most of the time a hitting 50% of the range makes you "proficient". LinkedIn is too restrictive with the assessments score range needing to be in a top 30% , which could exclude proficient users who scored 14/15 where as an equivalent 8/15 on an indeed assessment could make you "proficeint" making less skilled applicants look falsely skillful. I would prefer a system combining indeed choice to show any skills test results, with a clearer, stricter "skills limit" linkedIn like to use therefore working around linkedIn's exclutionary practices.

//10/6-7 similar general aptitude tests for two different companies, second one seemed a bit more my style

//10/17 human generated data assessment, had to assess AI responsed and write a human generated story

//11/1 panel, Electrical management systems and Scada important technology/missed research prep

//11/2 market research shows not all fotune 500s seek to underpay in atlanta.

//11/5 HE select - 2 hours for 10 points, shouldn't have struggled as much with recurtion, so need to practice, Bananas difficulty scale starting at a leet code hard for the "easy".

//11/7 appreciating 33

//11/10 got partial solutions/ ran out of time to optimize to pass all tests

//11/15 top 5% of 1.3mill for front end developer skills assessment on linkedin

//11/17 nov circuits, off to a great start with confusing asks and examples that don't clear up easily confusing directions. Missing fact, output is a "subarray", meaning slice of original array, order remaining

//11/24 late js solution to problem I reviewed

//12/14 review/prep for jp take 2
//12/15 bit stuck string manipulation in python on first problem but passed all tests, got 8/13 on second for time but put optimized solution I came up with in last 5 minutes in comments at the end 2% more familiarity with python and I could have probably attempted the refactoring.

//12/16 dec circuits, two potential solutions after reviewing first set, 20 points, need optimaization. The inputs this circuits ... just wow, had to download the sample input to even be able to fully copy the 1000 line example input to help figure out the problem, inspite of the poor inputs and the time running out an hour earlier due to daylight savings, I scored 40 points on a second tier question 15 minutes late

//1/5 easy?

//1/10 screen/late TehBS belittles applicants durring interviews, seemed like a scam until the tech vocabulary section, then just felt like dealing with a close minded gate keeper.

//1/17 data structures linkedin learning practice with java data structures

//1/19 node.js assessment, learned a bit too late where the imports were, and the environment information mislead me. got 20 pages with 10 results per, just needed time to perform the ask with that data. debugged a similar solution saved in relay mvp to ensure I can handle what was asked.

//1/19 second attempt allowed, nailed it thanks to the debugging previously saving time to debug informatoin manipulation issues once information was filtered. learned Number cannot handle ,s

//1/30 tried countering experience based rejection, low chance it pays off for current role.

//2/1 fair

//2/5 assessed a form designed by a staffing company, annoyingly no swe

//2/6 math heavy screening was nice to see how well that information was stored in my brain and how well google helps with the gaps after lack of use of geometry vocabulary.
