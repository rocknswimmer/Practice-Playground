//8/11 another hiring event on hackerEarth where I ran out of time thanks to needing to spend more than 30 minutes extracting and testing the extraction of the test information from a document, since they waste users time by not having a proper test environment that can run the function being tested by inputing varibles and running multiple sites. could have also finished in time if not translating javascript to java.

//8/17 remo confusing take another hacker rank but then try to test on site. learned about python lambda functions.

//8/18 August Circuit start - slow solution for first problem gets me to 60/100, need to figure out how to optimize in java. adjusted and got 100! learned a good bit from input manipulation despite how annoying it is to spend most of each problem figuring out how to optimally extract data. For example I had issues splitting a string and comparing the values for equivalence to avoid converting them to integers. There I learned for arrays of strings, you must use .equals instead of ==.

//8/20 coding challenge that was too easy/basic

//9/30 react coding challenge, could not compare my solution to their tests, but as far as I can tell I found solutions to all react challenges. finished 30 minutes early but not sure if thats what effiecency means for evaluations or efficent enough. Not sure if I should have put the todo component inside of a list item or not, made considerations for it while coding, but then noticed the built component and just mapped returning those.

//10/2 decided to retake linkedIn's react multiple choice assessment and only know I did better than 64% of takers, not my score out of 15. I'm not sure which site offers less useful assessments since indeed just gives you a range and most of the time a hitting 50% of the range makes you "proficient". LinkedIn is too restrictive with the assessments score range needing to be in a top 30% , which could exclude proficient users who scored 14/15 where as an equivalent 8/15 on an indeed assessment could make you "proficeint" making less skilled applicants look falsely skillful. I would prefer a system combining indeed choice to show any skills test results, with a clearer, stricter "skills limit" linkedIn like to use therefore working around linkedIn's exclutionary practices.

//10/6-7 similar general aptitude tests for two different companies, second one seemed a bit more my style
