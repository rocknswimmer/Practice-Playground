//5/1/24 leveling up while exploring the different paths started with algorithms path, and am getting familiar with how the site works. a bit more intro before the clash yest would have helped, but I came close and now know that muscle has gotten weak.

//5/2 lot more clash matches today to practice, don't like when it ends on you and you loose code/environment, have been 2 mins away several times

//5/3 ran a few more clashes for int prep/ calm nerves not sure if just getting easier ones, or if the muscle is starting to strengthen the following is the most rediculous fewest bits clash code, tells how many socks needed to guaruntee a matching pair, print(+readline()+1)

//5/5 imporved old golfs with what I have learned to climb rankings, still want to know the super tricks for halving my code again

//5/5 Reduce the key to js golf? check moveRobotGolf.py

//5/10 landed everywhere but highground
//5/11 reached disiple level/ top 10000
//5/12 broke top 1000 in clash, so finished 3 challenges the last 500 pointer jumped me from lvl 10 to 12
//5/14 post interview clashing to destress robot lab maker solution made after finding a second bot puzzle

//5/15 bot4life to bronze league, not as many points as I would hope, but needed 2 bronze

//5/17 more clash, though I may be done soon

//5/20 decompress after anxiety filled weekend with some clash

//5/21 won js reverse event

//5/23 just had an event clash with double spaced separation. if you split a double space on a single space you get a lot of empty strings included in the array in js at least. Not sure if I missed double space instructions, but it was also a reverse clash where you have to figure out the problem you are solving, so no instructions like input is double space separated.

//5/24 beat some zombies, not sure why my distance doesn't seem to be calculating right, but get enough of a score for the challenge
