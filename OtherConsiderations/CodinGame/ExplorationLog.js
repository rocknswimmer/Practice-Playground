//5/1/24 leveling up while exploring the different paths started with algorithms path, and am getting familiar with how the site works. a bit more intro before the clash yest would have helped, but I came close and now know that muscle has gotten weak.

//5/2 lot more clash matches today to practice, don't like when it ends on you and you loose code/environment, have been 2 mins away several times

//5/3 ran a few more clashes for int prep/ calm nerves not sure if just getting easier ones, or if the muscle is starting to strengthen
