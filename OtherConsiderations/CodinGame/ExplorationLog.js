//5/1/24 leveling up while exploring the different paths started with algorithms path, and am getting familiar with how the site works. a bit more intro before the clash yest would have helped, but I came close and now know that muscle has gotten weak.

//5/2 lot more clash matches today to practice, don't like when it ends on you and you loose code/environment, have been 2 mins away several times

//5/3 ran a few more clashes for int prep/ calm nerves not sure if just getting easier ones, or if the muscle is starting to strengthen the following is the most rediculous fewest bits clash code, tells how many socks needed to guaruntee a matching pair, print(+readline()+1)

//5/5 imporved old golfs with what I have learned to climb rankings, still want to know the super tricks for halving my code again

//5/5 Reduce the key to js golf? check moveRobotGolf.py

//5/10 landed everywhere but highground
//5/11 reached disiple level/ top 10000
//5/12 broke top 1000 in clash, so finished 3 challenges the last 500 pointer jumped me from lvl 10 to 12
//5/14 post interview clashing to destress robot lab maker solution made after finding a second bot puzzle

//5/15 bot4life to bronze league, not as many points as I would hope, but needed 2 bronze

//5/17 more clash, though I may be done soon

//5/20 decompress after anxiety filled weekend with some clash

//5/21 won js reverse event

//5/23 just had an event clash with double spaced separation. if you split a double space on a single space you get a lot of empty strings included in the array in js at least. Not sure if I missed double space instructions, but it was also a reverse clash where you have to figure out the problem you are solving, so no instructions like input is double space separated.

//5/24 beat some zombies, not sure why my distance doesn't seem to be calculating right, but get enough of a score for the challenge

//5/29 solved community event Snail Run


//5/31 warm up clash/536th after todays clashes

//6/3 clash event

//6/4 478th!!!

// won js reverse event
//6/11 fiver event first league cleared


//6/19 Bronze league/ four different games!!! Took a look and decided to focus on diving event because you can guaruntee a win. Made it to Silver league!!!

//6/21 getting a score with all mini games at least silvered, so not in the middle of silver league

//7/8 clash event, more languages being tracked

//7/11 learned sum of 2^0+...2^(n-1) = (2^n ) - 1

//7/13 just learned that -0 exists in programing, not sure how I have not encountered this before

//7/17 jumped all the way back from 500s to 300s still haven't broken into the top 300

//7/18 solved event matching text puzzle, though did not pass all of my edge cases, those were not properly tested

//7/22 new clash event, tripped up in java need to use .equals instead of == for string comparisoin to work

//7/23 solved a groovy reverse, translated groovy for the first time in less than 11 minutes

//8/19 clash event, factorials over 500 in js go in infinity without solution

//9/14 reviewed solutions for weekly puzzle

//9/17 clash event, got an error on second test with 10 sseconds to go, but seemed to have passed every other test. def a case where I wish you could stay in the IDE after a clash to learn.

//9/20 was passing all tests on c# reverse, on submit however something is different. This is my biggest issue with clash is the in ability to find out what changed from before and after submitting. Can insure all possibile edge cases are tested before and after submitting if you make sure all edge cases are covered in the before submit tests. With revese it is extra had because I was trying to figure out what was wanted from a bunch of input output statements.

//11/1 c++ reverse success.

//11/18 frequency decription, close list does not produce needed results

//12/18 checked out stream options
