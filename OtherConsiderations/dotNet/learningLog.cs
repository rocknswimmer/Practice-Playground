//5/29 continuing the course, basic grade print, learned \t does not add a tab, but moves to the next "tab spot" could only add a space if 3/4 of the way through the tab space when added. Seems like a real design flaw.

//6/6 First clash event in c# took way long due to looking up alot of basics, but got a 100% solution

//6/12 creating objects and learning about the various classes in the .net library

//6/26 boring bool basics
